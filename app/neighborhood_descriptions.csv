1,alki point,"As with the rest of West Seattle, Alki has a relaxed feeling, and you can tell the residents are ultra-proud of their ‘hood. Visitors covet the beachfront condos and the place is packed during the summer for beach volleyball tournaments and picnics. In the off-season, locals claim their neighborhood once again."
2,arbor heights,
3,atlantic,
4,ballard,"Because of its wide variety of residents, Ballard has a very unique personality. You’ve got the let’s-go-out-for-happy-hour crowd, the early-morning-market crowd, the trendy-shop-and-salon crowd, and the late-night-debauchery crowd. You can see it all in one spot–Ballard Avenue. This street was once the commercial district, but now houses about a gazillion restaurants, shops, bars, and art spaces. On one block, for instance, you can find the Smoke Shop (a complete dive bar frequented by fishermen), a self storage facility, a few of the trendiest bars in Ballard (Ocho, BalMar, and Volterra, for example), an architecture firm, and a music venue. Expand this example to Ballard as a whole, and you’ve got a pretty good idea of what it’s like there."
5,beacon hill,"Depending upon where you are on Beacon Hill, you’ll get a different feel for the neighborhood. The busiest section is on the north end, especially where Beacon Hill meets the Rainier Valley. Up at the top of the hill, things settle down into a nice residential area with a small business district. The farther south you go, the more secluded and quiet things get."
6,belltown,"Depending upon where you are on Beacon Hill, you’ll get a different feel for the neighborhood. The busiest section is on the north end, especially where Beacon Hill meets the Rainier Valley. Up at the top of the hill, things settle down into a nice residential area with a small business district. The farther south you go, the more secluded and quiet things get."
7,bitter lake,
8,brighton,
9,broadview,"Broadview is decidely residential. While Greenwood Ave is packed with apartments, condos, townhomes and a few small commercial areas, everything west of there is a quiet neighborhood filled with single-family homes.
Most homes were built betwenn 1940-1980, so it is one of the newer Seattle neighborhoods. As you might guess, homes in the flatter area to the east are modest and affordable. As you move down the slope towards the Sound, stunning views give way to fancier and pricier homes. There are even some gigantic estates tucked back in the forested areas."
10,bryant,"Bryant has a well-kept-secret sort of feel. It’s mainly residential and full of some extremely charming houses, but there are a few areas around the University Village and along 35th Avenue that contain businesses. This is a great place to be if you enjoy the surrounding neighborhoods but like to be in a quieter location."
11,capitol hill,"Capitol Hill is funky and fast-paced, with an endless number of cool blocks to explore and, unfortunately, a limited number of parking spaces. During the day, markets, boutiques, and salons are a big draw. Nightlife is hopping with clubs, bars, and music venues, and you’ll often find coffee shops that moonlight as cocktail lounges. Individuality and fashion statements are encouraged, and there always seems to be some sort of block party or community forum to encourage residents and visitors to mix and mingle."
12,cascade,
13,central district,"The location of the Central District—well, it’s very central, you see. It doesn’t have a big business district of its own, but it borders Capitol Hill, First Hill, and the Madison Valley, all of which are hopping with activity.
The community is very proud of its diversity; a festival is held yearly to “strengthen community pride, integrity, and spirituality while promoting cultural diversity throughout the Central District.”. Other organizations, like the Central District Forum for Arts and Ideas, devote their time to promoting the arts and culture of the African American community."
14,columbia city,"Columbia City has the highest Walk Score of any neighborhood south of downtown, including the ever-popular “Junction” in West Seattle. Translation: there’s a lot to do here, and it’s all concentrated in one area. The people here love to support the local businesses. For example, I talked to a guy working at a little boutique who not only lived in the neighborhood but also bartended at the pub next door. In fact, he may have just been filling in at the shop as a favor to the owner. The point is: people get along harmoniously here in Columbia City."
15,crown hill,"Crown Hill is a little oasis of calm between the busier Ballard and Greenwood. The feel among the residences is very small-town and peaceful, though the business district is quite active. It’s a very involved community, too, with constant opportunities to bond with the neighbors, whether it’s a community garage sale night, a park clean-up work party, or an Annual Night Out for crime prevention. Every year, residents in Olympic Manor team up to create a beautiful holiday light display that is a popular sightseeing opportunity for people all over the city."
16,delridge,
17,denny blaine,"Denny-Blaine is a haven for those who want a quiet, well-kept neighborhood that’s still relatively close to the city center. It’s strictly residential, so you won’t find a lively business district or many day visitors here. What you will find are stunning houses along meandering streets that end in cul-de-sacs."
18,downtown seattle,"To say that the vibe here is “lively” seems like an understatement. Dynamic? That’s closer. Exuberant? Better still. Whatever word you choose to describe it, Downtown is the place to be if you want nonstop activity, love being surrounded by interesting people, and want to see something new every day. Obviously, there are major events going on here regularly, but it’s just as easy to find your own little hideaway that only a resident would know about."
19,dunlap,
20,fairmount park,
21,fauntleroy,"Considering its relative isolation from the busier parts of Seattle, it’s no surprise that the vibe in Fauntleroy is mellow. The place is quiet and serene—how could it not be with such great views of the nearby islands and the Olympic Mountains? But there is one thing that people get fired up about around here: environmentalism. Residents work tirelessly to protect the natural habitats along the waterfront and Fauntleroy Creek. They are always conscious of the way the ferry terminal and human activity affect the area’s parks and wildlife. So if there’s one reason why they like to keep it quiet around here, it’s probably so that the environment will remain beautiful for future generations."
22,first hill,"In keeping with history, the attitude of this area continues to be “stay close to the action!” It’s an easy bus ride or walk down to the business district, and an equally short distance to the also-bustling Capitol Hill. It has its own little section of businesses along Madison Avenue that provide plenty of opportunities for dining, shopping, and people-watching."
23,fremont,"Come to Fremont if you feel the need for more excitement in your life. One glance at the neighborhood’s event calendar and you’ll see there is always a party here. The main business district has a huge variety of different eateries, a brewery, a chocolate factory, and access to one of the best sections of the Burke Gilman – right along the Ship Canal. Not to mention non-stop action at the Fremont Draw Bridge. There is a pretty decent hillside as you go up to 45th – so you can get a good calf workout as you take a deeper dive into the neighborhood to check out the gorgeous homes and off-the-beaten path businesses."
24,gatewood,
25,genesee,
26,green lake,"The general attitude in Green Lake seems to be Get Off Your Lazy Bum, Son! The people here love to get outside, whether it’s just to walk to the library or grab dinner, or head down to Green Lake park for a run. There isn’t a huge nightlife scene here, although you could take country line dancing lessons at The Little Red Hen or catch a live band on Friday nights at the Latona Pub.
In general, the people are friendly and have an early-to-bed, early-to-rise lifestyle."
27,greenwood,"Today, Greenwood’s business district remains as successful as it was decades ago. The area around 85th Street and Greenwood Avenue is booming with coffeehouses, antique stores, bars, and eateries, along with a community theater. The community hosts many events that appeal to families and urbanites alike. Things tend to quiet down at night, which makes this the perfect place to live if you like to be on the move during the day and a homebody when the sun goes down."
28,haller lake,"The atmosphere in Haller Lake varies widely depending on where you are in the neighborhood. On its edges, near Aurora Avenue to the west and Northgate Way to the south, are the business districts (and the traffic we mentioned before). As you head towards the center, the activity fades and quiet residential streets take over. With larger plots of land than other places in the city, residents can spread out a little and enjoy the quiet."
29,holly park,
30,lake city,"There’s something for everyone in Lake City. The area’s main thoroughfare, Lake City Way, bisects the neighborhood and is the best place to go if you want a bustling atmosphere. Newly constructed condos and businesses mingle with the retro establishments from years gone by. Farther out, the feel is more residential and quiet. Even though it is one of the most populous and spread out neighborhoods in the city, the community is close and knows how to work together to solve issues."
31,leschi,"Perched atop Lake Washington with fantastic views, a harbor and a sweet business district, Leschi has a very casual, laidback feeling. Close to downtown, the scenic drive out to Leschi puts you in a relaxed state of mind – far from the frenzy of the city."
32,madison park,"It’s hard not to feel a little fancier when you’re hanging out in Madison Park. The houses are beautiful, the shops and restaurants are classy and unique, and it’s far enough away from the city to make it seem like you’ve really gotten away on vacation. It’s also clear that the community is a supportive one; there are always events going on to honor local artists or give a nod to new businesses that have set up shop."
33,madrona,"Madrona is the place to be if you want to live in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood yet still be within a stone’s throw of downtown. OK, maybe not a literal stone’s throw, but the residents do enjoy one of the lowest average commute times in the city, at 22 minutes. Wholesome family events are easy to find; movie nights, cultural parades, outdoor concerts, knitting groups, and wine tasting to name a few. This is a true community, with everyone working together to make it the best place to be. It’s no wonder they claim to be “Seattle’s best kept secret!”"
34,magnolia,"Because it’s on a peninsula, Magnolia has a secluded feel. Looking at the neighborhood from outside, you might think there isn’t much more there than houses and a marina. Wrong! The area around McGraw Street and 34th Avenue W is a little pocket of activity, with a Walk Score rivaling that of Fremont or Greenlake. A glance at the neighborhood’s blog shows that there’s always something going on here, be it a farmer’s market, the yearly SummerFest celebration, a free nature walk at Discovery Park, or a spur-of-the-moment community outreach event. Not to be left out is Fisherman’s Terminal, located right on Salmon Bay near the 15th Street Bridge. Here, you can walk around on the docks and admire the real-life fishing boats, then stop in at the market to buy the seafood caught that very day. Though not as famous as the Pike Place Market, rumor has it that this is an even better way to experience the local fishing culture."
35,mann,
36,maple leaf,"Walking or driving through the neighborhood, you definitely get the feeling that this is a true community. “Welcome to Maple Leaf” signs adorn telephone poles, people are out walking with their babies or dogs, and when you go in a local business you are greeted with genuine enthusiasm. The Maple Leaf blog advertises nearby deals, alerts readers to community events, and educates about city-wide issues that may effect residents, with the odd missing-dog announcement thrown in."
37,matthews beach,"You can tell that the people who live here have a respect for nature. Houses are tucked into the shade of giant old evergreen trees and the Burke-Gilman is woodsier than in other parts of the city. Just south of the beach, the natural habitat has been restored to be friendlier to native plants and animals. And while the residential area is a bit secluded, it isn’t far to Lake City Way or Northgate where more of the action lies."
38,meadowbrook,
39,minor,
40,montlake,"This is a community that rallies together to solve issues, usually revolving around environmental preservation. Hot-button issues include the ever-evolving debate about the Highway 520 bridge that cuts through the neighborhood, habitat restoration, and the upkeep of the area’s parks. Not that they can’t let loose and have fun. The community center hosts events like a fall festival, Minute to Win It nights, all kinds of sports and music lessons, and ‘tot’ programs for the little guys."
41,mount baker,"The atmosphere around here is pretty quiet, especially on the Lake Washington side; you’d never guess you were in the middle of a huge city. Farther west, along Rainier Avenue, things are a bit busier, with block after block of businesses. With the recent addition of the light rail station, people can more easily commute in and out of downtown."
42,north admiral,"A quick perusal at the Admiral Neighborhood Association website give you a glimpse into what the vibe of the community is. They claim to be “comprised of residents, business people, and others who care about the environmental, economic, and social sustainability” of the neighborhood. And care, they do. Events like clean-up days, outdoor concerts, community forums, and art walks get everyone involved and feeling like part of something bigger."
43,north beach / blue ridge,"Though years have passed and new types of people have moved in, Blue Ridge has kept its reputation as an elite community. A fancy community club, pristine landscaping, and streets that have a private-access kind of feel further cement this notion."
44,north college park,
45,olympic hills,
46,phinney ridge,"This area is the perfect mix of quiet neighborhood meets in-city energy. Phinney Avenue just begs to be strolled down and enjoyed. New eateries, coffee shops, and fun boutique shops are opening up all the time, and the Phinney Neighborhood Association keeps a steady string of community events on their calendar."
47,pinehurst,
48,portage bay,
49,queen anne,"Well, it depends where you are on the Hill. Lower Queen Anne backs up to the Seattle Center (which includes the Space Needle, Key Arena, Science Center, etc.) and is close to all that downtown has to offer. East and West Queen Anne, which meet in the middle at the top of the hill, are both great residential areas that share a common business district along Queen Anne Avenue. North Queen Anne, which faces Fremont, is home to Seattle Pacific University and has a quieter feel."
50,rainier valley,"A peek at the calendar of events on the Rainier Valley Post Blog shows that this is an organized community who takes great pride in the diversity of the neighborhood. To name a few popular events: International Music and Arts Festival, Big Day of Play, community clean-up days, and the Summer Streets Block Party and Heritage Parade. So even though the residential area is on the quiet side, it’s clear that Rainier Beach can be a place to be out and about, too."
51,ravenna,"This is a remarkably quiet neighborhood, considering how close it is to the hubbub of the U-District and Greenlake. In fact, that’s a good way to describe the general vibe here: kind of, ‘We want to be in on the fun, but we don’t want it to keep us up at night.’ A small stretch of 65th Street near 20th Ave NE provides just enough activity to entertain the residents and draw in a few outsiders for a visit. Ravenna is also proud to call the University Village—aka “U-Village” shopping center part of its family; it’s one of the biggest attractions of the area, not to mention of the city in general!"
52,roosevelt,"Roosevelt is a little peppier than Green Lake and Ravenna, and a little less so than the University District. The intersection of two busy streets—Roosevelt Way running north to south, and 65th Street running east to west—forms a lively business district. The surrounding blocks have a mix of newer apartments/condos and original homes from the early 1900s. It’s a great neighborhood to enjoy on its own and is centrally located to give you easy access to other parts of the city."
53,seaview,
54,south lake union,"It seems that people can’t get enough of South Lake Union these days. Everyone wants to either live here, work here, or come visit. New businesses are opening daily, transportation options are improving, and hip restaurants seem to open almost weekly. Perusing the neighborhood’s website gives a glimpse into what life is like here on a daily basis—tons of events, buzzing press releases about the new amenities, and a great interactive map that shows all of your options for exploring. The neighborhood is quickly being dominated by local technology companies. Amazon.com’s new headquarters is in the neighborhood, and you’re sure to see thousands of Amazonians roaming the streets at lunch time. Other stalwarts like Microsoft and UW Medicine also have a large presence in the neighborhood, along with plenty of up-and-coming tech startups. (The authors of this site hail from South Lake Union.)"
55,south park,"In the past decade or so, South Park has seen a time of refreshing changes. The Duwamish Waterway Park was built along the river and Cesar Chavez Park provides a place to enjoy sculptures and local art. New housing options have been built, and the older ones are gradually being spruced up. Businesses have been moving into the area as a response to the new population growth. All in all, good things are in the future in South Park."
56,stevens,
57,university district,"True to the predictions of its developers, the University District really is a ‘city within a city.’ It is a hub for public transportation (and just wait until the light rail arrives in a few short years!), has its own shopping center in the University Village, and houses a ridiculous number of ever-changing restaurants, bars, and shops along The Ave. Suffice it to say that there are enough things to do to keep thousands of college students busy at all hours of the day and night, year-round."
58,victory heights,
59,view ridge,"This primarily residential area is definitely tranquil and well kept; houses have yards and streets have roundabouts. It’s a great place to be if you aren’t a fan of traffic and other city noise, though you don’t have to go far to run your basic errands; Wedgwood is just down the hill. Plus, if you’re the ‘club’ type of person, Sand Point County Club and View Ridge Swim and Tennis Clubs are both located in this neighborhood."
60,wallingford,"Wallingford has a nice mix of down-home, been-here-forever places (Dick’s Burgers and the Durn Good Grocery, for example) and trendy, hot-for-fall places, like Molly Moon ice cream and Tilth. The busiest area is along 45th Street, which is always bustling with activity as people visit the ever-changing lineup of restaurants, bars, and shops. Farther from the action lies the residential area with some pretty cool old homes."
61,wedgwood,"Wedged (har har) right in the center of north Seattle, this is a great place for families or anyone who wants a quiet and cozy atmosphere that’s still close enough to the action of the city. You’ll find modest houses that once in a while give way to pockets of bustling streets with shops and restaurants (nearly every block has a business that shares a name with the neighborhood—“Wedgwood Dental/Hair Studio/Broiler, etc.”) Strolling down 35th Ave NE is a good way to get a feel for the community, since this is where most commercial businesses are located."
62,westlake,"Westlake is a very narrow sliver of a neighborhood, sandwiched between Aurora Ave and Lake Union. Three major arterial roads cut through the neighborhood as the main routes from downtown to neighborhoods like Fremont, Ballard and Wallingford. Transport to and from downtown is easy, either via bus, car or bicycle.
Westlake does house quite a few folks in a hodge-podge of accommodations. There are still 100 yr homes mixed in with more modern apartments and condos and even some townhomes. Like Eastlake, Westlake also houses a significant enclave of houseboat dwellers along the northwest shore of Lake Union.
Despite its small size, Westlake is fairly crowded, with parking sometimes difficult on its crowded, narrow streets. It is also the land of urban condo/apartment dwellers with very few kids. There are also quite a few office buildings in this area, including some of Seattle’s most unique offices with parking spots for your boat underneath!"
